    <p>Welcome to My Exercise Plan!</p>
    <p>Are you ready to get started on your fitness journey?
        This simple exercise plan will help you build a foundation
        for a healthier and more active lifestyle.</p>
    <p>Day 1: Walking<p>
    <p>Start with a 15-minute brisk walk around your neighborhood
        or a nearby park. Focus on maintaining good posture and breathing rhythmically.</p>
    <p>Day 2: Stretching</p>
    <p>Perform a 10-minute stretching routine to improve flexibility.
        Include stretches for your neck, shoulders, arms, legs, and back.</p>
    <p>Day 3: Squats</p>
    <p>Do 3 sets of 10 squats. Squats are great for building lower body strength.
        Keep your back straight, and go as low as you comfortably can.</p>
    <p>Day 4: Rest</p>
    <p>Rest is essential for muscle recovery. Take a break today and focus on staying hydrated.</p>
    <p>Day 5: Push-ups</p>
    <p>Perform 3 sets of 5 push-ups. If regular push-ups are too challenging,
        start with knee push-ups and work your way up.</p>
    <p>Day 6: Jumping Jacks</p>
    <p>Do 3 sets of 15 jumping jacks. This is a great way to improve cardiovascular
        fitness and burn calories.</p>
    
    <p>Day 7: Rest</p>
    <p>Another day of rest to allow your body to recover. Focus on healthy eating
        and staying active by walking or stretching.</p>
    <p>Remember:</p>
    <p>Stay hydrated throughout your workouts.
        Listen to your body; don't push too hard, especially if you're just starting out.</p>
    <p>Consistency is key. Try to stick to your exercise plan and
        gradually increase intensity as you become more comfortable.
        Consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any
        new exercise program, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.</p>
